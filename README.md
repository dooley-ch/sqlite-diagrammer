# SQLite Diagrammer

## Introduction

This is a simple little utility that reads the database schema from an SQLite database file and generates an ER diagram using [mermaid.js](https://mermaid.js.org/intro/).  The generated text file can be enhanced by adding additional comments, changing the relationship types and adding various style elements (see the [mermaid documentation](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/entityRelationshipDiagram.html) for details).

Visual Studio Code can be used to visual the diagram using the "Markdown Preview Mermaid Support" extension.


## Sample Database

This repository includes a sample database file for testing.  The database schema is described in the following diagram:

## Output

The following diagram was created from the text file generated by the application, without any additional enhancements:

## Usage

The application is very simple to use:

1. Select the database file by using the browse button at top right hand corner of the applications main window.
2. Use the copy button to place the generated code on the clipboard.
3. Use the save button to save the diagram in a markdown file.
